   * Bad code kill the company .
   * No major redesign again, after clean code .
   * Rigidity System : ``` a system which a single change or enhancement forces to make many changes on other parts of the system  .```
   * Rigidity System are unpredictable because you don't know how many modulus are depend on each others .
   * Fragility :  ``` system break many parts when you change one part .```

   * Going fast: programmers who write the bad code, don't go fast . If you want to go fast, go clean .
   * Clean Code : code quick with few cycles, 
   * do random active cleaning on your code .
